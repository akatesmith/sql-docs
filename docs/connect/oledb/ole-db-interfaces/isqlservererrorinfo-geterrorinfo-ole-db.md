# ISQLServerErrorInfo::GetErrorInfo (OLE DB)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  Returns a pointer to an OLE DB Driver for SQL Server SSERRORINFO structure containing the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error details.  
  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server defines the **ISQLServerErrorInfo** error interface. This interface returns details from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error, including its severity and state.  

  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
HRESULT GetErrorInfo(  
   SSERRORINFO**ppSSErrorInfo,  
   OLECHAR**ppErrorStrings);  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *ppSSErrorInfo*[out]  
 A pointer to a SSERRORINFO structure. If the method fails or there is no [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] information associated with the error, the provider does not allocate any memory, and ensures that the *ppSSErrorInfo* argument is a null pointer on output.  
  
 *ppErrorStrings*[out]  
 A pointer to a Unicode character-string pointer. If the method fails or there is no [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] information associated with an error, the provider does not allocate any memory, and ensures that the *ppErrorStrings* argument is a null pointer on output. Freeing the *ppErrorStrings* argument with the **IMalloc::Free** method frees the three individual string members of the returned SSERRORINFO structure, as the memory is allocated in a block.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 S_OK  
 The method succeeded.  
  
 E_INVALIDARG  
 Either the *ppSSErrorInfo* or the *ppErrorStrings* argument was NULL.  
  
 E_OUTOFMEMORY  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server could not allocate sufficient memory to complete the request.  
  
## Remarks  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server allocates memory for the SSERRORINFO and OLECHAR strings returned through the pointers passed by the consumer. The consumer must deallocate this memory by using the **IMalloc::Free** method when it no longer requires access to the error data.  
  
 The SSERRORINFO structure is defined as follows:  
  
```  
typedef struct tagSSErrorInfo  
   {  
   LPOLESTR pwszMessage;  
   LPOLESTR pwszServer;  
   LPOLESTR pwszProcedure;  
   LONG lNative;  
   BYTE bState;  
   BYTE bClass;  
   WORD wLineNumber;  
   }  
SSERRORINFO;  
```  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|*pwszMessage*|The error message from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The message is returned through the **IErrorInfo::GetDescription** method.|  
|*pwszServer*|The name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on which the error occurred.|  
|*pwszProcedure*|The name of the stored procedure generating the error if the error occurred in a stored procedure; otherwise, an empty string.|  
|*lNative*|The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error number. The error number is identical to that returned in the *plNativeError* parameter of the **ISQLErrorInfo::GetSQLInfo** method.|  
|*bState*|The state of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error.|  
|*bClass*|The severity of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error.|  
|*wLineNumber*|When applicable, the line of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] stored procedure that generated the error message. If no procedure is involved, the default value is 1.|  
  
 Pointers in the structure reference addresses in the string returned in the *ppErrorStrings* argument.
